This may be for example, words required often, family members, words related to work or hobbies for adults or curriculum-based words for children. \r\n\r\nAt first the words should all begin with a limited set of initial sounds (e.g. 9). The words should be known to the person (e.g. in the child's receptive vocabulary). The number of items could vary between 10-50 depending on age, motivation etc. The idea is to cycle through these items in a set of treatment sessions. It is advisable not to select sets of items that are very close in meaning (e.g. lion and tiger) or in sound (e.g. transparent and transport) to work on at the same time. \r\n\r\nAgree a picture to represent each item. In the case of verbs or adjectives this could involve discussion. In those with good comprehension a definition of the item may be used rather than a picture. \r\n\r\n##Step by step instructions for helping people produce target words using Keyphone\r\nOnce you have accessed keyphone on the web choose whether the person prefers upper or lower case letters. Drag the required set of letters so only these show. Ask the person to name the items (in response to pictures or definitions) one at a time. \r\n\r\n##Cueing Hierarchy\r\na) In the first 2 sessions ask the person to press the correct initial letter and listen to the cue (even if they know the item) before saying the word. This will familiarize them with the aid \r\n\r\nb) If the person selects the wrong letter, limit the choice to 3 (the correct letter and 2 distractors)\r\n\r\nc) If they are unable to name the item with 3 letters available, show them the correct letter to select\r\n\r\nd) If they are still unable to produce the word, say it for them to repeat \r\n\r\nIn this way each target item is produced at least once per session. In subsequent sessions use the same cueing hierarchy but do not require use of keyphone for words that are returned without help. \r\n\r\nIntervention may be developed by; \r\n\r\nUsing different items\r\nUsing items starting with a larger set of letters\r\nUsing keyphone to cue word finding in connected speech\r\n",
